# Dirty Kitchen

A collection of utility functions written in TypeScript to make my life easier when I need the various functionality in my every day life and projects.

## Scripts

Builds the collection of utility functions and writes the output to a dist folder for easier porting between projects.
```bash
npm run compile
```

Delete dist folder as the TypeScript compiler crashes if an types directory exist before compiling source
```bash
npm run clean
```

Executes the two commands above to provide a quick and easy build process of the source-files.
```bash
npm run build
```
